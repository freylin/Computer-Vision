1.Install VLFeat before running.
I have commended “run('vlfeat/toolbox/vl_setup’)”.

2.The vocab size of default vocab.mat is 400.
I also save several vocab matrices of different size, you can rename them as ’vocab.mat’ to use.

3.Gaussian mixture model’s parameters are save as means.mat, covariances.mat and priors.mat (size = 400)

4.For proj4_SUN397_database, put folder ’SUN397’ in folder ’data’ and run. I also pick 15 categories (more than 200 images in each) and store their paths in ‘ClassName2.txt’ for debugging.
